# Getting started

- If you have logged in to the Virtual Coach for the first time, you can change your password [here](https://mindscape.jnaapti.io/default/user/change_password).
- Read all the content in the "Learn Concepts" section.
- Each skill takes you through a cycle - we start with an overview of what the skill is all about. Then you are given an Activity to work on. You need to understand the problem. You are then given a choice - you can either attempt to solve the problem, or you can decide to Tinker with content and lessons in the Lab. You then solve the problem by submitting your solution. Your solution will then be reviewed by your mentor. Posts are intended to replace Email - so you use them to tell your coach what you worked on, where you got stuck, any doubts you have, any hints you need, any solutions you obtained, even partial solutions with issues you are facing etc.
