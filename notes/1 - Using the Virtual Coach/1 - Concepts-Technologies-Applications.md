# I graduated from Engineering. Now what?

What is our responsibility as Engineers? The job of an Engineer is to solve problems using technology. The job of a software engineer is to solve problems using Software Technology.

What are examples of applications that Software Engineers build? If you look at apps in your mobile phone, they are all examples of what Software Engineers build.

# The Missing Gap in Technical Skillset

Do you think you are adequately prepared to start your career in the software industry? Do you have the required technical skills to build applications like these? What do you think is lacking in terms of your technical skillset?

When we ask this question, we typically get students confirming that they have a theoretical understanding of the subjects but they lack application knowledge. They talk about a gap between what they learn in their curriculum and what is expected of them in the industry.

Let us dig deeper and understand what that means.

Our Engineering curriculum covers a lot of subjects. In the 4 years of Engineering, we learn subjects like Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, Networking, Operating Systems, Finite Automata, Compiler Design, Programming Languages etc. Do these subjects have any relevance in the industry?

Of course, they do! Every single subject mentioned above is required to build a search engine like Google or a social networking site like Facebook. While Data Structures and Algorithms is at the heart of everything in Computer Science, databases are required to store data permanently for retrieval in future (the pages on the web, people in your network etc). When you access these applications on a mobile phone or a browser, you are using the concepts of Networking. All these applications are deployed in data centers where each of the machines has an Operating System. The code is written using one or more programming languages, which is then compiled using a compiler. The design of a compiler internally uses concepts of Automata Theory.

We can go on, but we hope we have made our point. All these subjects are of great importance. No doubts about it! However, the real question is, are they sufficient to build applications mentioned above?

The answer is, "No", and that's where the real gap is.

# Technologies - the missing piece in the puzzle

What else do we need to build applications like Google or Facebook?

We need tools and technologies.

What are examples of such tools and technologies that we need to know of?

This is a vast subject and there are several technologies for each concept. Let us look at this in a little more details. The subject "Programming Languages" teaches you the theory of a programming language; what a programming language is, how it works etc. C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python etc are examples of programming languages. These languages implement the concepts that you learn in the subject, "Programming Languages". The industry expects you to know one or more of these programming languages and not just know the concepts of Programming Languages.

Another example: the subject "Databases" teaches you the theory of storage and retrieval of data from a persistent device like a hard-disk. It talks about concepts like tables, primary and foreign keys, normalization, queries etc. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra etc implement these concepts.

So let us understand the relationship between Concepts, Technologies and Applications.

Applications are built using several technologies. Technologies implement Concepts.

Now if you understand what your curriculum focusses on, where do you think the major focus is? The focus is on learning concepts, but the emphasis on technology is very minimal. Through the entire Engineering curriculum, we learn about 2-3 programming languages, a couple of databases etc. However, the applications in the world out there are built with several programming languages. There are more than 20 popular programming languages (popular in this context simply means languages that are used in applications today), more than 20 popular databases, more than a couple of dozen MVC frameworks etc.

Examples of programming languages used in applications today: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Python, Scala, Clojure, Erlang, PHP, Ruby, etc.

Examples of databases used in applications today: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Neo4J, etc.

# A Technology Ninja?

A word of caution. Never brand yourself with a technology. Never call yourself a "JavaScript Ninja" or a "Python Geek" etc. The reason is when the technology gets outdated so will you!

You should rather aim to be a good engineer. An engineer's job is to solve the problem at hand. He uses the best tool available in the industry to solve it. He is not sentimental about the tool, rather he is passionate about solving the problem. You should learn to be that!

# Being successful as an Engineer

How many of these do you know? How many do you think you are supposed to know?

What if you learn a programming language, but the company where you work uses a different language?

There is one more problem (or we would call it an opportunity) with technology.

Technologies have a very short shelf-life. The technologies that were prevelant in applications 10 years back and outdated today. Technologies used in applications today were perhaps not even invented 10 years back. So what do you think are the most popular technologies 10 years from now?

It's hard to predict that given the history, isn't it?

However, the good news is concepts don't change so often. Relational database technology is more than 50 years old, the concepts of TCP/IP that we used today hasn't changed much since the 1960s!

So what's the best way to be successful in this industry?

The short answer is:

(a) Get really solid with concepts - the more time you invest in solidifying your conceptual knowledge, the better it is. (b) Learn as many technologies as you can fit into your schedule. Learn as many programming languages as you can. Learn as many databases as you can. There is no upper limit.

The good thing about this kind of technology exploration is, once you have explored a few diverse technologies in a domain, you sort of "get it". It becomes easier to explore a new technology even if you have not seen it. If you have worked with about 5-6 databases, the next one is easy to pick up. The analogy is, "It's like watching a 100 Hollywood movies of different genres" and once you have watched enough, you can sort of predict what the next movie is going to end like by the time you have reached the intermission (watched half the movie).

Fill your mind with as many diverse technologies as possible so that you not only learn those technologies but also get good at exploring new technologies on your own.

These courses have been designed in such a way that you will not only get good at the technologies you are being trained on, but also learn the art of learning on your own.
