Here are some resources to get you started:

[Byte of Python](http://www.ibiblio.org/swaroopch/byteofpython/read/index.html)

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

**Please note:**Â The trick is in not reading every single thing before working on the problems. You try to solve it as quickly as you can - you may not necessarily understand everything in Python - that is perfectly alright. Also, you can use Google to get more resources.
