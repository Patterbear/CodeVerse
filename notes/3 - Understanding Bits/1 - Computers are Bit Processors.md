Computers can only understand bits (i.e. 0s and 1s). The input to a computer is a sequence of 0s and 1s, the processing is of these sequences of 0s and 1s, and the output is another sequence of 0s and 1s.

How is it that it can do all the things it does? We can play games, view photos, play videos and surf the Internet all with this one machine. It is hard to believe that all this can be achieved with just 0s and 1s.
