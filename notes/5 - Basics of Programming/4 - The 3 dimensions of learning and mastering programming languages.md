There is a possibility that we will encounter several programming languages during our career.

How many programming languages are there?

Care to venture a guess? [Check this out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type).

New programming languages are emerging as we speak. How can we learn a new programming language quickly? Is there a trick?

Here we teach you the art of learning "any" programming language.

We have come up with a simple chart to help beginners understand their approach to learning programming languages. We call this the "3 dimensions to learning a programming language".

Here is a summary of the 3 dimensions:

1. The first dimension is what we call as "Basic Constructs".
2. The second dimension is "Programming Paradigms".
3. The third dimension is "Third party libraries".

Dimension 1: They say that if we know 20% of a human language (English/French/â€¦), we can use that in 80% of the cases. So the trick in picking up a new language is to not go and buy a dictionary and start mugging up the words, but in finding out what those 20% words are that we can use to have a reasonable conversation. Programming languages are similar. This 20% is what we can call as the "Basic constructs" and forms the first dimension of learning a programming language.
