# How it works

In order to understand how jnaapti works, let us look at a scenario. Ram has just joined a company right out of college. It has been decided that Ram will be working on a project that uses Lucene and Hadoop (2 buzzwords). Ram only has a superficial knowledge of Java. Ram has been assigned a buddy Mahesh.

Mahesh asks Ram to start learning Lucene. He also recommends that he buy a few books from the local bookstore and also a few resources online. So Mahesh visits the bookstore and picks up a book on Lucene.

He soon realizes that, in order to learn Lucene, he also needs to know Java, and he is not sure about his capabilities in Java. So he chooses a book on Java too. He then realizes that, he also needs to brush up his Object Oriented Design skills, so he picks up a book on that too. He also is not sure about his Data Structures skills, and the Java book seems to be talking about collections, Lists, Maps etc. So he picks up a book on Data Structures.

Ram needs to learn Lucene, but he now has 5 books in his hands, and he wonders if he has to read all 5 to get started with Lucene. So he goes back to Mahesh and asks him to help out. Mahesh looks at the books that Ram has picked up and marks a few chapters in each book and asks Ram to learn these chapters in the required order. Ram says he knows a few of the things already and asks if he can skip them. Mahesh wonders if there is a better way to shorten this process.

Enter jnaapti Virtual Coach - Mahesh logs in to the jnaapti Virtual Coach and selects the skills that Ram should be learning, and jnaapti creates a custom course for Ram. Mahesh can then customize the course further and check-off the skills that he already has.

Ram then starts the learning process. Each skill takes Ram through a learning cycle. A learning cycle starts with an overview of the skill - which describes what the skill is all about.

No matter how much of theoretical knowledge a learner has, meaningful and relevant questions emerge and the creative thought process kicks in when the learning is given a context. The jnaapti program concentrates on providing this context in the form of activities derived from real life problems. Further, learners learn best, when they can relate new concepts to concepts that they already know. We have seen that, knowledge attained this way, is retained for a much longer time.

Ram is given an activity to help him appreciate the domain. He can either attempt to solve the problem immediately or learn a few things before attempting.

Ram decides that, while he understands the problem, he is unsure about how to solve it. So he proceeds to the next phase - the Learning phase. During the learning phase, Ram is given some content to learn from.

He also has an embedded terminal where he can try out things. He is also shown demos of some of them in working.

Once Ram has mastered the concept, he proceeds to solve the problem. Mahesh then only verifies if the solution is ok.

The activities are chosen based on the current knowledge of the learner. The activity could be either a programming activity, a design activity or something else. Learners learn on their own or as a group, and come back with a solution. Every learner however is expected to individually work on the tasks. The learner and the buddy then discuss the solution and assess how the learner progressed, and move onto the next skill. The activities try to concentrate on helping learners strengthen their fundamentals. Every activity tries to stretch the comfort limits of the learner, a little at a time.

# Pre-requisites

Hard-work and perseverance - the don't give up attitude is a must have if you want the program to be successful.
