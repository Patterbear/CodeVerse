- Python is an interpreted language so actually it's common to write code in an interactive shell. You may not necessarily use an IDE to write Python code, although if you want to, you can use one like Eclipse (with Python plugin) or one listed here: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/126753/is-there-a-good-free-python-ide-for-windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/126753/is-there-a-good-free-python-ide-for-windows)
    
- One very cool shell available for Python is [ipython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/).
    
- Read about [Read-eval-print loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop)
    
- You can write code and see results immediately. You can then access a history file (~/.ipython/history) and copy and paste the code into a source file.
    
- You can install ipython in Ubuntu using apt-get:
    
    `$ sudo apt-get install ipython`
    

Feel free to explore ipython and other tools.
