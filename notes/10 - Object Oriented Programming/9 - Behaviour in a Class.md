So we have learned the concept of putting state in an object. Now, to make any modifications to the state of the object we send messages to the object via method calls. A method is nothing but a function in a class that acts on the state of the object. In usual contexts, the class contains the definition of the behavior that is applied on instances of the class. Let me repeat this because it's an interesting observation. The class contains the method definitions, but it acts upon the state of the instance.
