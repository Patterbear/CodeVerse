Why do we need specialized programming languages (like C, Python or Java) to talk to a computer? Why can't computers understand English?

We know that computers are basically bit processors. They take a stream of 0's and 1's, do some processing and generate another stream of 0's and 1's. Computers don't know what that bit processing "means". It is we humans who give a meaning to those bits.

Computers don't speak human languages? Why can't we use a human language to speak to a computer? One reason is that, human languages are ambiguous. We use sarcasm (saying something without meaning it) and computers don't understand this.

As an example, read this sentence first and see what it means to you:

Rob doesn't know that John shot Jim.

Now see how the meaning changes with the stress:

**Rob** doesn't know that John shot Jim

Others perhaps know

Rob doesn't know that **John** shot Jim

Rob knows someone shot Jim, but he doesn't know it was John

Rob doesn't know that John shot **Jim**

Rob knows that John shot someone but he doesn't know it was Jim

Another reason is that we can have grammatically correct sentences which are absolutely non-sensical. Here is a famous statement composed by Noam Chomsky:

[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously)

Another reason is that, we as humans, know to speak a language, but we ourselves don't know how it works. We speak grammatically correct English, but we may not necessarily know the grammar of English, isn't it? We perhaps learnt to read and write in English first and then we learnt its grammar (the concept of subject, predicate, object, adjective, noun, pronoun, verb, adverb etc).

So, we now have a problem. Computers can only understand 0's and 1's. We only speak human languages. Computers cannot understand human languages and we can't speak in 0's and 1's. So how do we make a computer execute tasks for us without requiring us to speak in 0's and 1's?

So until we figure out how our human languages work and we can make a computer understand it, we need something specialized, something that acts as a bridge between what humans want to do and what machines understand.

Programming languages are the way we do this. A programming language forms an intermediary between us (humans) and the computer. The nice thing about a programming language is that it resembles a human language (mostly English, although it doesn't need to be so), so it is easy for us humans to learn them and describe our problems and solutions to those problems. A programming language removes all the issues of human languages (no sarcasm, ambiguity, etc). But the good thing about these programming languages is that they can be easily converted to 0's and 1's, which means we can make a machine understand the instructions that we have expressed in the programming language.

### Trivia about human languages and programming languages

While computers don't understand human language, there is one language that comes close and there are researchers who are trying to figure out if it can be used as a computer language. Do you know what language it is?

"Sanskrit"

There have been attempts to make a computer understand commands given by a human being. Siri and Wolfram Alpha are examples of such systems. But these are still in very early stages of what we refer to as "General AI".
