This is a very long post and your first job is to read this in its entirety.

# Persistence

- If there is one thing to make this program a success, it is persistence.
- We have seen that there are lot of people who join this program and a few of them give up - but the ones who continue are the ones who see the most success. You decide which category you want to be in!
- There are moments when you won't enjoy it, but you just keep on keeping on.
- As the master in the Karate Kid movie said, "It takes time, nature's law, not mine."
- It takes years of practice. People never stop practising. Learn to be a life-long learner.
- You will be spending atleast 3-4 hours on this every day - no questions asked. Most importantly, you won't give up!

# Confidentiality

Henceforth, I request you to keep all the information that we exchange confidential. This includes questions, solutions that you write, any content/suggestion that I send etc.

# Environment

Unless you have worked out a different arrangement with your coach, all work should be done in Ubuntu Linux.

# Complexity

The questions are at varying levels of complexity - you will solve them even if you find them to be too easy. Sometimes, what I am looking for may not be obvious - I will let you know after you have solved it.

# The individual brain

Solve these problems independently - please ask _me_ if you need anything.

# Rule of the 6 hours

If you don't understand a question, ask me immediately. Carefully study the requirements and ask me questions if you are unclear. But if you don't know how to solve it, try for atleast 6 hours before asking me. This includes any issues that you might face with installation etc. But don't spend more than 6 hours either - if you are stuck let me know.

# Non-perfectionist

The practice sessions are the ones where you make all the mistakes. It's perfectly fine to make mistakes. Any solution is better than the most efficient solution.

# Simplicity

Always look for simple solutions and also look to reuse maximally. Take the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle to heart.

# Googled

Using Google to get information and code snippets to help you learn is OK. Using Google to get solutions for the problems is not OK. You are the best judge of what is appropriate. Knowledge is more important than source of knowledge - where you learn from is not important, what you learn is.

# Code as art

Keep the code clean - remember to take care of edge conditions. Remember that I am not interested in just the output, but in clean, descriptive code and the process you followed. _Let your code make you proud._ Understand the concept of replicable deployment - Always remember to document every single step that is required for another person to get your code to work. Download this, extract, install, configure, etc - document everything.

# Open assessment

After you solve the problems, we discuss the solutions and arrive at an assessment. Both of us agree on the results before we proceed to the next cycle.

# Communication

Most of our interactions will happen via the VLE. Since we are working remotely, the more the communication, the better. Send the solutions to me as soon as they are ready and you think it is done - don't wait until all the activities are completed. Multiple posts per day is perfectly fine.

# Rule of Constant Communication

Post in the VLE atleast once per day - so I know you haven't silently quit. If you are a student, keep me informed about upcoming tests/exams etc. There is a health indicator - make sure it does not turn orange (or red)! Use email only when VLE cannot be used.

# Post Etiquette

While multiple posts are fine, think twice before you hit the Send button, read and preview your posts an extra time. Respect each other's times. Always use formal English - professionals don't like IM lingo. The subject line is optional, but you can write a clear and short description of the body if you wish.

# Attaching Code

Write code in a file and attach it in the post. As far as possible, don't paste code in the posts. Give the file a meaningful name. This way, I can refer to line numbers when commenting on the code.

# Turnaround times and health

I will be measuring the time a problem is given and the time the learner comes back with the solution. An additional time that could be measured by the learner himself is the time he actually spent in solving the assignment. For example: Let us say, I send you the assignment at 12pm on Jun 14th. You got to work on Jun 15th from 5pm to 7pm and you send it back to me by 7:30pm. The total turn-around time is 31.5 hours. The time spent on the assignment is 2 hours. The latter is measured by you if you want. I expect a turnaround time of 24 hours for most problems (unless they are projects - in which case it might take longer). This is mutual - you can expect a similar turnaround time from me as well (for the next set of problems or any comments on the existing solutions).

# Misc

The Jnaapti program is self driven. The coach can only guide you. You build your own personality. The coach's job is to nurture it. As a sidenote: If you have some skill, nurture it - don't let it go waste - & don't bother about how you can use it (does it have scope etc) and this does not apply only to Computer Science.
