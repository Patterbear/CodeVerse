Now let's say I don't need order in a list. All I care is that I want them to be unique. I shouldn't have tomatoes twice in my list but it doesn't matter what order they appear in.

In this case I can use a Set.

Representation:

`set ([ "Toothpaste", "Matchbox", "Tomatoes", "Chips" ])`

This is a perfectly valid set:

`set(["a", 12, "Monkey"])`

# Properties of sets

- Items are unique
- Order of items do not matter
