Now, a kernel is not very useful by itself. What makes it useful is when you combine it with tools that we end up using to interact with systems. This includes software like GNU Coreutils that includes several of the commands that we use in modern day systems.

https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html

Here is an incomplete list of commands that are part of Coreutils:

- cat
- head/tail
- wc
- sort, uniq
- ls, cp, mv, rm
- chown, chgrp, chmod, touch
- echo
- â€¦

There are several other tools that GNU has built, including bash, gcc, emacs, nano, etc.

Many other people have contributed several popular software that we have grown to love and use on a daily basis.

So when someone says, I am learning Linux, what they are perhaps referring to is not the kernel, but the tools that Linux comes with.

Note that these are not part of the kernel, but these are tools that you will find even in a basic installation of Linux. Purists would call this GNU/Linux, where Linux refers to the kernel, and GNU refers to the tools, like the ones mentioned above.

Isn't this true about other Operating Systems too?

What's so different about Linux?

One thing that makes Linux different is that it is Free and Open Source Software. The kernel was built by Linus Torvalds and the GNU project was lead by Richard Stallman.
