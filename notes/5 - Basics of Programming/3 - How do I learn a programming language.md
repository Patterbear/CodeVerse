All of us know at least one human language. Some of us know multiple. How did we learn human languages?

Did we start with the grammar? No! Grammar "happened" to us. We didn't consciously learn it. When our moms taught us our mother tongue, she most certainly didn't open the grammar book and start teaching us from that!

We perhaps started by learning a few words. Then we learnt to put these words together - we learnt to put 2 words together and then started forming longer sentences.

Imagine that we are in a new city and we don't understand the local language. How do we learn to communicate with the local people? We will perhaps learn to greet them, respond to someone when they greet us, learn about various food items and how to order them etc. In other words, we learn some basic, commonly occurring words and how to put them together and communicate.

Similarly it is with programming languages. We start by learning some basic constructs. Then we learn to form more complex sentences (or statements).
