# Inheritance

The second type of relationship between the entities is a "is-a" relationship. For eg: Eagle "is-a" Bird, Employee "is-a" Person.

This type of relationship is called Inheritance.

Why do we need this?

Inheritance relationships are good to do 2 things:

1. To extend the behavior of an entity - Entity B is exactly like Entity A, but it also has these additional properties. Eg: Eagle extends Bird - Eagle has all the properties of a bird like 2 legs, 2 eyes etc, in addition we have some special properties.
2. To modify the behavior of an entity - Entity B is exactly like Entity A, but it is different this way. Eg: A FastCar extends Car - it has all the properties of a Car, but a FastCar rides faster, unlike an ordinary Car.
