# Maps

Now let's say in the grocery shopping list, you want to identify the quantity and prices of each item:

```
Toothpaste - 1, Rs. 54
Matchbox - 10, Rs. 15
Tomatoes - 1kg, Rs. 10
Chips - 1, Rs. 15
```

What we are basically doing is, we are identifying several properties of an item, but we are using some name to identify these set of properties. The name that is used to identify the set of properties is called a key, and the properties identified is called the value for the key.

This is represented in the following way:

```
"toothpaste" : { "quantity": "1" , "price": 54 }
"matchbox" : { "quantity": "1", "price": 15 }
"tomatoes" : { "quantity": "1kg" , "price": 10 }
"chips" : { "quantity": "1", "price": 15 }
```

In general a map is represented in flower brackets with keys and values separated by a : character.

# Properties of Maps

- We need to identify the items based on a specific property (this is called the key)
- The item being identified is called the value

## Examples of Maps

Let's say we are watching a cricket match and I ask you to list the scores of all the cricketers. If you are storing this data in a map, what is the key and what is the value?

The key is the name of the cricketer, the value is their score.

If we have the number of medals that various countries have won, the key is the name of the country and the value is the number of medals.
