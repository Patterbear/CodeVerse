Popular Operating Systems like Windows and Mac are controlled by one organization, eg: Microsoft controls the development of Windows, while Apple controls the development of Mac. As far as Linux is concerned, there are multiple organizations working together in terms of the actual development. Linux therefore is different in terms of how you install it, how you set it up, and the way you use it.

Linux was written by Linus Torvalds as a hobby project in 1991. It was later released under GNU General Public License. Until then, UNIX was the most popular Operating System among universities and businesses.

After the release of Linux, it gained in popularity very fast and is now one of the most widely used Operating Systems in the world.

Today Linux powers everything from mini devices (IOT devices), phones, desktops, servers, cars and what not!

### Is Linux popular? Who uses it?

Linux has gained wide adoption in the server market. Today, some of the biggest corporations like Google and Facebook run almost their entire application software on Linux. Linux is also the kernel in Android phones and is therefore the most widely used Operating System on phones. Linux has not gained wide popularity in the Desktop market (use in Laptops/Desktops) though. However, most distributions also provide a Desktop Edition of their distribution. Eg: [Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) and [Fedora Workstation](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/).
