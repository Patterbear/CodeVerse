Bits are 0's and 1's. Bytes are a way of looking at a bunch of bits at a time. 8 bits together form a byte.

A byte is still too small. If we were to ask the number of bytes we can store in a hard-disk, it becomes difficult to comprehend how big that number is. So we have ways to group bytes together.

- A KiloByte (KB) is 1024 bytes
- A MegaByte (MB) is 1024 KBs
- A GigaByte (GB) is 1024 MBs
- A TeraByte (TB) is 1024 GBs

We then have PetaBytes, ExaBytes and so onâ€¦
