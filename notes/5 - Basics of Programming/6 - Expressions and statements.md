When we combine variables, values and operators, we get expressions.

Here are some examples of expressions:

```python
a + b
a + 10
a + b + 10
```

Expressions by themselves don't change the value of anything. When we say:

```python
a + b
```

neither the value of `a` changes, nor the value of `b` changes.

However if we say:

```python
c = a + b
```

the value referred to by `c` has changed after the execution of this. These are referred to as statements.

Here are some examples of statements:

```python
c = a + b
x = x + y
z = z - 10
c = 2 * 3.14 * r
pi = 22 / 7
```

Statements don't need to be only mathematical in nature. We can also ask the system to do things like print a string in the console (or your screen). Here we are asking the system to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console:

```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

`print` in the above statement is called a function. We will learn more about functions and function calls in a later lesson.

### Trivia about "Hello, World!"

"Hello, World!" is one of the first things we learn to "say" in a programming language. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#Examples) is how we can do it in various programming languages!
