In computer programming, an anonymous function or a Lambda function is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier. Lambda functions are often:

- arguments being passed to higher-order functions, or
- used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to return a function.

# Advantages

1. If the function is only used once, or a limited number of times, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function.
2. In some situations, such as binding events to callbacks, it is more efficient, more readable, and less error-prone than calling a more-generic named function.
