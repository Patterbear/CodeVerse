Ok, now you have learnt about the basic constructs of a language and you start writing code. And you get so good at it that you now have a few thousand lines of code.

Then you go on a trip with your friends and are back after a week. And you see your code and it seems completely alien. What did I mean here? What is this for loop doing? Why is this condition required?

You have just run into the first road-block in handling complexity.

When we write small pieces of code, we usually don't run into issues of code complexity. But when the amount of code runs into a few thousand lines, it is difficult to keep the entire thing in our head if we don't use good design principles.

There are several ways in which complexity is handled.

Let us look at a couple of ways in the next sections.
