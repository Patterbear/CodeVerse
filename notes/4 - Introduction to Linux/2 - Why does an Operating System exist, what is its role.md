So, we have a machine. What is a machine? A machine could be your laptop, the laptop through which you are accessing this platform and reading this is a machine. This machine is made up of hardware and software.

There are some important pieces of hardware that we usually refer to more than others. For eg, we have the CPU, the RAM (usually referred to as memory), there are storage devices and then there is network (network adapters, and interfaces). Then we have some input/output devices, eg. the keyboard, the mouse, the screen etc.

So, on one side is the hardware and on other side is the human. The human wants to use this hardware to solve problems. To work with the hardware, you need to understand how these hardware devices actually work.

For eg, let's say you want to work with the storage device in your laptop. To write something to this device, you need to know what type of storage you are using. Is it a magnetic disk? Is it a solid state drive? Depending on the type of the device, there may be a different way to drive it. The hardware devices also keep evolving. If you talk about the RAM, we had DDR3, then we had DDR4. The CPU instruction sets keep changing. So, as a human, especially a layman, who perhaps doesn't have a Computer Science background, or for that matter, even for those with one, it may not be easy for you to interact with these devices directly, since every device is unique and has its own way of functioning.

This is what an Operating System solves for us.

An Operating System gives us a uniform interface to us, the humans, to be able to leverage the power of the hardware that a certain system comes with.

In Linux, for example, if you want to write something to a file, say, you want to write a string `Hello` to a file `foo`, you can say something as simple as:

```
echo Hello > foo
```

When you execute this command, it takes the string called "Hello" and it writes this string into this file, "foo". Now, remember that this file is in a storage device (could be a magnetic disk or a solid state drive). This string is being written into that device. Take a moment to imagine the wonder of this!

The devices have their own way of functioning, nonetheless, one thing that is common about all of them is that they all speak binary, i.e., they only understand 0's and 1's. For eg, you send a sequence of 0's and 1's to your CPU, ask it to perform an operation (another sequence of 0's and 1's) and it throws back another sequence of 0's and 1's. The RAM also works with only 0's and 1's.

So this string, "Hello", which makes a lot of sense to me as a human, internally has to be converted into binary and that binary has to be written into this device depending on how the device functions. So there are multiple layers of complexities here. The beauty of the simple command above that my Operating System provides is that it hides all of that complexity from me, the human, and gives me a simple interface to interact with that device.

So, the Operating System is playing that role of hiding the complexity of the hardware devices and giving me a simple interface to work with that as a human. It gives me a uniform interface irrespective of the types of devices underneath. So whether my laptop has a solid-state drive or a magnetic disk or a USB mounted into my laptop, or a remote network storage device connected to my laptop, this same command works - it has to do different things with different devices, but the command looks exactly the same!

This is the beauty of Operating System interfaces! It gives me a simple way to function while hiding the layers of complexity underneath.

A typical university course on Operating Systems talks about topics like Process Management, another on Memory Management, and on Filesystem Management, Input/Output, Networking (sometimes this is a subject on its own!).

If you compare this to our above discussion about hardware devices, you will perhaps see some correlation.

- Process Management is about CPU
- Memory Management deals with RAM
- Filesystem Management deals with storage devices (hard-disk, solid state drives)
- Input/Output deals with various Input/Output devices
- Networking deals with network devices (network adapters, network interfaces etc)
