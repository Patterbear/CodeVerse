ðŸ’¡ Linux systems are filled with shortcuts and it is worth your time to master them to improve your productivity. For eg, the shortcut to open a terminal in most Linux Desktops is, Ctrl+Alt+t.

Historically, a terminal was a device with which you would send inputs and receive outputs. Today, the terminal is the "black screen" where we can type commands and see the results of the commands.

There is some historical reason why they are called terminals/consoles, although they may not be quite relevant anymore. However, we still end up using these terms in common lingo. Someone may tell you, "Type this in your terminal".

History of terminals:

A shell is a program that the terminal sends its input to and the output of the shell is what is displayed in the terminal. This is the first thing you see when you login to a machine (in Server editions) or login to a remote machine using SSH. This is the place where users execute commands and thus interact with their Operating System and the resources underneath. There are several popular shells in Linux:

- Bash
- zsh
- fish
- â€¦
