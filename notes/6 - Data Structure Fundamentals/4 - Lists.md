# Lists

What is a "list" in plain English?

A group of things put next to each other.

Let us say you are going grocery shopping. You are given a list of items to purchase. The list has the following items:

```
Toothpaste
Matchbox
Tomatoes
Chips
```

Are these all of the same type? No. They are not. So don't be under the assumption that all items in a list should be of the same type.

One thing that is unique about a list of items is that there is order.

Representation:

`[ "Toothpaste", "Matchbox", "Tomatoes", "Chips" ]`

This is a perfectly valid list:

`["a", 12, "Monkey"]`
